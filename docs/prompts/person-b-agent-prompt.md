You are an autonomous engineering agent working on the Vigil hackathon project. You will implement the ENTIRE "gate" workstream end-to-end in one session and only stop when everything is done, verified, committed, and pushed. Do not stop to ask me questions or for confirmation — this is a time-boxed hackathon and I am not available to answer. Make reasonable decisions and keep going.

CONTEXT: Your workstream is the technical heart of the whole project — the single-use, scoped, just-in-time permission gate that lets Vigil fix production without holding standing credentials. It is degradation priority #1: the gate service with real single-use grants MUST work; Pomerium routing layers on top of it.

SETUP (do this first):
1. You are in a clone of git@github.com:psagar29/vigil.git. Run:
   git fetch origin && git checkout person-b-gate && git pull origin person-b-gate
2. Read these files fully before writing any code:
   - docs/plans/2026-07-17-master.md  (overall architecture, merge model, ownership zones, honesty table — the "why")
   - docs/plans/2026-07-17-person-b-gate.md  (YOUR step-by-step plan — the "what" and "how")
   - src/lib/contract.ts  (the FROZEN contract — GrantRequest, GrantResponse, VerifyRequest, VerifyResponse, PORTS all come from here)
3. Understand your two callers (both from the contract): vigil-agent POSTs a GrantRequest to /grants and expects a GrantResponse; payments-api POSTs a VerifyRequest to /grants/verify on every destructive call and expects a VerifyResponse — and verification CONSUMES the grant (single-use).

HARD RULES (violating these breaks the team merge):
- You OWN: services/gate/** and pomerium/** ONLY.
- You must NOT touch: services/vigil-agent/**, services/payments-api/**, services/diagnostic-worker/**, frontend src/**, and especially NOT src/lib/contract.ts (frozen — do not edit even if tempting).
- If you believe the contract genuinely must change, DO NOT change it. Work around it and write docs/CONTRACT-CHANGE-REQUEST-B.md explaining what and why, then continue.

POLICY THRESHOLDS (must match the demo story exactly — rule ORDER matters):
Evaluate in this order so the thrash denial reads "blast radius over limit":
  1. blast radius: deny if servicesAffected > 3
  2. sandbox: deny destructive action if sandboxPassed is false
  3. budget: deny if budgetUsed > $5
  4. repeat failure: deny if consecutiveFailures (self-reported) OR gate-observed denials for this requester+action >= 2
Otherwise allow, minting a single-use token with a 60-second TTL scoped to exactly one action + one service.

EXECUTION:
- Work through docs/plans/2026-07-17-person-b-gate.md task by task, in order: Task B1 → B2 → B3 → B4.
- Follow TDD strictly for B1 and B2: write the failing test file, run it (npx tsx src/<name>.test.ts), watch it fail, implement, run again, watch all assertions pass. These tests are your safety net for the most important component in the project — do not skip them.
- The plan contains complete code for every file. Type it faithfully. Fix any obvious TS error and note it in the commit.
- Use Node with tsx and Express. Node v25 is installed. Import contract types via relative path (../../../src/lib/contract).
- For B4 (Pomerium): FIRST fetch the current Pomerium docs (pomerium.com/docs — routes + policy for Pomerium Core, docker quickstart) and correct the config.yaml in the plan to current syntax rather than trusting the snippet blindly. The goal: /rollback and /restart route through Pomerium (:4300 → payments-api :4100) and NOTHING else in prod is routable through it. If Pomerium policy syntax fights you for more than ~30 minutes, keep the layered model (Pomerium restricts routes; payments-api still verifies the single-use grant with your gate on every call), document exactly what you verified in pomerium/README.md, and move on — the grant enforcement is already real at the service.
- After EACH task run its verification block and confirm the expected output literally appears. Commit after each task with the exact message the plan gives.

MANDATORY VERIFICATION (definition of done — do not claim completion until all pass):
1. Unit tests: npx tsx src/policy.test.ts  AND  npx tsx src/grants.test.ts — every assertion passes.
2. Full grant lifecycle by hand (from Task B3), with the gate running (cd services/gate && npx tsx src/server.ts &):
   a. POST /grants with a scoped sandbox-backed rollback → verdict "allowed", a vg_ token, ttlSeconds 60, singleUse true.
   b. POST /grants/verify with that token → {"valid":true}.
   c. POST /grants/verify with the SAME token again → {"valid":false,"reason":"grant already used"}  (proves single-use).
   d. POST /grants with mass-restart / 12 services → verdict "denied", reason "blast radius over limit".
   e. GET /grants → shows the decision log with the recorded decisions.
3. Pomerium: /rollback is routed (non-502) and a non-destructive path like /logs returns 404 through :4300 (proves only the two destructive paths are reachable). If you fell back to the layered-only model, that's acceptable — just make it explicit in pomerium/README.md.
4. Clean up any background processes you started.

FINISH:
- Push your branch: git push origin person-b-gate
- Then write a final summary telling me: which tasks completed, the exact output of the grant-lifecycle checks (paste the allow/verify-once/verify-twice/deny responses), what Pomerium enforcement level you achieved (real policy vs layered-only) and why, and anything the merge coordinator (me) needs to know — especially any divergence from the plan.
- ONLY stop after the branch is pushed and the verification above has passed. If one task blocks you for more than ~20 minutes, implement the simplest thing that makes its verification pass, note it in your summary, and continue — never halt the whole run over a single blocker. The gate policy + single-use grants (B1–B3) are non-negotiable; Pomerium (B4) can degrade to the layered model if needed.
